# N-bench Profile

Create and consume shareable SDLC profiles (`/nbench:profile`).

## What this skill does

1. Detects machine setup (MCPs, CLI tools, skills, apps, patterns, model prefs)
2. Asks skill scope each export: global, project, or both with de-dup (name + hash)
3. Applies application curation memory (saved apps, new apps, optional re-include missing)
4. Builds public-anonymous immutable snapshot payload with auto-redaction
5. Publishes to N-bench profile link service
6. Imports with compatibility checks and per-item consent before install
7. Supports owner tombstone for immutable links

## Product constraints

- Secret handling: auto-redact and publish
- Visibility: public anonymous, minimal metadata only
- Link policy: immutable, non-expiring snapshots
- Owner control: tombstone supported
- Import defaults: skip already-installed, compatible-only OS filtering
- Manual-only entries: allowed with setup notes + verification guidance
- Priority tags: every item supports `required` or `optional`

## Input
